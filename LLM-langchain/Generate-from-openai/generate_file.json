        "question": "Hey, my Dell Inspiron 11-3180 speaker is not working properly. Do you have any idea how I can replace it?",
        "answer": "To replace the speaker on your Dell Inspiron 11-3180, you will need to follow a series of steps. Firstly, flip the Chromebook to have the bottom facing you and make a note of all screws. Remove all nine 6mm screws on the bottom with a size #00 Phillips screwdriver. Then, flip the Chromebook upright and open it. Using an iFixit plastic opening tool, wedge it into the seam of the bottom plate and create a small gap between the sections to pry it open. However, do not fully remove the bottom plate yet as there are connected wires. Before pulling off the back completely, disconnect the MB cord using blunt-nosed tweezers. Once the bottom plate is removed, disconnect the speaker cable from the board and move the coin cell battery wire out of its holding place. Finally, lift the speaker from both sides to release it from the rubber stubs holding it in place. Always be cautious while handling the parts to avoid any damage to your device. Good luck with the replacement process!"

        "question": "My Canon EOS 60D left-side port cover is broken, how can I replace it?",
        "answer": "To replace the left-side port cover on your Canon EOS 60D, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Use a thin piece of plastic, spudger, or fingernail to lift up the edge of the grip and pull up slowly. Repeat for the other two grips. The large one on the battery side is the easiest to start with. This is required to remove the front and back panels. The small one on the back is a bit difficult to get started, but not really difficult to remove. The one on the AV panel will be easier if you open up the AV port cover. Remove the adhesive by rubbing your finger against it. Remove the balled up adhesive. 2. Remove 3 screws. 3. Remove the small screw under the flip cover too. 4. Using a spudger, fingernail, or other thin plastic tool to wedge the panel off of the camera, start at the camera's front. Pulling on the rubber AV-cover may be enough to get it to move off the body. Only pull about 1/4' (3-5mm). There is a tab that will need to slide out. 5. Slide the rear part of the cover out. 6. At this point, the only thing holding on is that the dust-cover is hooked onto the front panel. Slide down to remove without damaging the cover. You can see how the cover and side piece fit together in the provided images."

The plastic is purely there for dust protection.\n8. When you lift the screen off of the rest of the camera, you will see a small piece of ribbon wire connecting the screen and circuit board. To remove this connection, you must lift the black bar at the base of the ribbon wire (on the circuit board), then slide the ribbon wire out.\n9. Congratulations! You have removed the screen, you can now replace it and reassemble your camera."

        "question": "My Steam Deck is not booting properly, it's not showing any signs of powering on. What should I do?",
        "answer": "If your Steam Deck is not displaying any signs of powering on, it may not be failing to boot but rather not powering on at all. Before trying more time-consuming solutions, try a force restart by holding the power button for ten seconds. If that doesn't work, disconnect any peripherals as they can cause issues. Also, ensure your Deck is actually powering on by checking for noises, a backlight, or fan noise. If you suspect a boot partition corruption, try manually selecting the boot file from the Boot menu by following the steps outlined in the instructions. If all else fails, consider a 'nuke everything' method which will remove all data from the device. Lastly, make sure to verify if your SSD has enough space to function properly as running at full capacity can impact performance and ultimately cause booting issues."
